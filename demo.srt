00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,840
Why are you sitting there!

3
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:37,330
I'm sorry!

4
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:39,460
Hurry, hurry.

5
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:40,910
Watch it.

<i>Episode 6</i>

7
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:45,490
Sorry!

8
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,130
<i>Oh what to do? Look at you shivering. </i>

9
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:52,230
Are you really cold?

10
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:55,200
Should..should we go to the hospital first?

11
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,480
It's okay. Just go.

12
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,290
How can I just go?

13
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:07,360
Then shall I take you home before I go?

14
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,930
Just go I said.

15
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:12,630
But... How can you go alone like this?

16
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:14,390
Please..

17
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,550
Please just go.

18
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:23,840
I am asking you.

19
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:48,130
Yes driver. Since he's cold, please turn up the heat and

20
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:50,200
take care of him until he gets home.

21
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,290
Yes. Thank you.

22
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:54,890
Cooold!

23
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:07,700
Seong Joon, why aren't you coming?

24
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,940
Ah, I am the driver.

25
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:15,270
The customer isn't feeling well so I am taking him home right now.

26
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:16,780
What?

27
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:19,810
I'm sorry. I have to go.

28
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:21,830
- What? <br> - I will explain it all later.

29
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:23,590
I'm sorry.

30
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:25,880
What is this?

31
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,590
Ah! I got dressed up for nothing.

32
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:34,560
I should take some selfies.

33
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:53,960
I don't know his apartment number.

34
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:57,770
<i>You're the tenant from 502</i>

35
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:13,090
Seong Joon.

36
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:16,960
Seong Joon.

37
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,720
Seong Joon..

38
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:03,260
Vinegar goes in here too?

39
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:06,290
I don't know.

40
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:08,670
Hye Jin.

41
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:11,250
Oh? Seong Joon.

42
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,930
How's your temperature?

43
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:15,290
It's a little better.

44
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,120
How did you get here?

45
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,310
I called you and the driver told me you weren't feeling well.

46
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:25,870
Soup is almost ready. Go lay down.

47
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:31,020
You waited for a long time earlier right? I'm sorry. I suddenly felt ill.

48
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,550
But why did you want to see me today?

49
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:40,640
I got your jacket back from the dry cleaners so I wanted to return it to you.

50
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:43,560
I was worried that you'd go around without any clothes on.

51
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,240
I have so much clothes so there's no reason for me to be naked.

52
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:49,160
I told you you can give it back to me at any time.

53
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:54,430
I have a habit of quickly returning any items I've borrowed.

54
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:58,730
Hurry up and go get rest. I will let you know when it's done.

55
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:01,550
Hurry. Hurry.

56
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:11,470
Why did he do that?

57
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:25,740
The rain was pouring down and I was looking at him like this..

58
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:30,570
and he did this to me.

59
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:35,910
Maybe I looked pretty?

60
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:40,110
Do you have the princess syndrome?!

61
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:45,000
Whatever it is, he probably caught a cold. Did he take his medicine?

62
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,480
It would be too much to go to his apartment, right?

63
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,160
Yes, too much. Too much.

64
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:58,800
Should I leave it at the guard's desk? Or by Quick? (Express delivery service)

65
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:00,400
<i>Weirdo Reporter </i>

66
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:02,820
Yes, Reporter Kim.

67
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:06,330
What is Reporter Kim? Reporter Kim?

68
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:08,580
We're not at the office.

69
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:12,930
What is my Dongseng (younger sibling) doing while it's raining? How about some rice wine and scallion pancakes with your Orabeoni? (formally, older brother)

70
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:15,800
But right now I have something I have to take care of.

71
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:20,480
Ah. Orabeoni, can I ask a favor-

72
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,730
Ah..no, no. Never mind.

73
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:26,810
What is it that you're being so ambiguous and can't tell me?

74
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:28,400
Tell me, what is it?

75
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:35,300
It's just that..Seong Joon got soaked in the rain and if you could get him his medicine for me..

76
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:37,950
What?

77
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:40,180
Never mind. What am I saying right now?

78
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:43,010
Don't worry about it. I'll go myself.

79
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:51,280
What is with her? She can't even talk to her first love and she wants to bring him some porridge?

80
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:58,420
A day like this calls for some rice wine and scallion pancakes!

81
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:04,930
Even if you go, you won't hear anything pleasant, Jackson.

82
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:10,060
Damn! Ah seriously.

83
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:19,670
- Yes. <br> - Our Dongseng probably knows because you've experienced me before.

84
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:22,540
I am not the kind of person who runs errands for people or takes care of patients but

85
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:25,440
whose request is this? It's my dongsaeng's request.

86
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,110
- What? <br> - So I was thinking about doing a porridge run for you.

87
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:30,770
Really?

88
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:34,200
Ah! Thank you Report- I mean, Orabeoni.

89
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:38,920
Then what is that thankful dongsaeng going to do for her orabeoni?

90
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,650
- What? <br> - You've heard before, right? Give and take?

91
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:45,950
If I fulfill your request this time, you have to fulfill three of my requests in the future. Call?

92
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:48,230
What? Why do I get three?

93
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:50,230
<i>I'm all about give and take.</i>

94
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:52,960
If you don't want to, it's fine. It's nothing for me to feel sad about. Hanging up now.

95
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,140
Ah, call, call, call! I got it. I will fulfill your requests no matter what.

96
00:07:56,140 --> 00:08:01,000
You say this now but are you going to act like a hostile and pretend this never happened?

97
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:08,560
This won't do. Repeat after me. 'I, Kim Hye Jin, promise to fulfill Kim Shin Hyeok's request three times, no matter what.'

98
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,100
Oh that's so random. An oath?

99
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:12,970
Hanging up.

100
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:16,870
'I, Kim Hye Jin, promise to fulfill Kim Shin Hyeok's request three times, no matter what.'

101
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:18,610
Amen.

102
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:28,970
Seong Joon, it's all ready.

103
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,380
Seong Joon.

104
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:39,290
You're asleep again.

105
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:42,430
You have to eat that before you take the medicine..

106
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:11,290
Huh? I've seen coffee shop unnies before but I've never seen a coffee shop oppa!

107
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:15,850
- Huh? <br> - Huh?

108
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,110
What is this?

109
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:21,790
You abandoned me and left earlier! What are you doing here?

110
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:22,900
I'm so sorry about earlier.

111
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:26,790
Someone who lives here had something urgent happen.

112
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:29,850
What about you Mr. Suite 2014? What brings you here?

113
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:32,140
Well, I too have someone here I know.

114
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:35,470
I have to..ugh..meet quickly about something..

115
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:38,530
Ah, about earlier, I'll explain it all to you later.

116
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:41,030
Okay. See you at the hotel.

117
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:42,720
Yes.

118
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,810
Five.

119
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:50,180
Mr. Deputy Chief Editor.

120
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:53,560
Deputy Chief Ji.

121
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,550
Ji Seong Joon?

122
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,160
Hey, Seong Joon!

123
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:02,520
Ah, I guess he's not here.

124
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:06,830
Then this thing. Should I leave it at the desk?

125
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:15,320
I had this with me. Open sesame.

126
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:26,010
What is this? He's here?

127
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:32,380
Ah, he's in deep sleep.

128
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:35,540
Ah!

129
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:39,460
This is that problematic puzzle or whatnot.

130
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:43,040
Listen here.

131
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:47,280
Your first love is the one who you always say

132
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,160
'Look Intern' to.

133
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:52,200
That Kim Hye Jin. Do you know?

134
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,690
Do you?

135
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:02,890
Did he buy himself the porridge?

136
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:10,730
Ah! How could food..smell like this?

137
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:13,600
Wow. A person could die from eating this.

138
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,260
Ah it's rancid! So rancid.

139
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:34,990
I guess he'll eat it when he feels like it.

140
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:39,450
Why is he sweating so much?

141
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,680
What is this?

142
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,410
Ah, why am I doing this?

143
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:26,770
Really..

144
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,560
Ah, Hye Jin!

145
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,750
Ah, you scared me!

146
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,480
You're up?

147
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,600
You're up?

148
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,500
What is Reporter Kim doing here?

149
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,370
I came over to make sure you weren't dead.

150
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:52,620
I heard you got soaked during the rain.

151
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:54,840
Who did you-

152
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:59,110
Ah...this Intern, uselessly meddling again..

153
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:03,090
But really, did you sleep here?

154
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:06,410
Ah..Then did you think I'd sleep out in the hallway listening to the sound of cicadas?

155
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:08,430
In this cool fall air?

156
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:10,780
Even wearing my dressing gown?

157
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:14,520
Oh this underwear! It's mine!

158
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:19,940
Oh I came over in such a hurry that I forgot to pack some underwear.

159
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:25,560
- But still, how can you put on someone else's underwear? Take it off right now.<br> - Really? Okay.

160
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:28,520
Ah, no, no. Just wear it. Have it.

161
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:31,900
Don't return it to me. Do.do..do..don't return it to me ever!

162
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:34,780
Okay. Yes! Underwear! Bonus item!

163
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:38,760
Go wash up. Let's have breakfast and go to work.

164
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:44,930
He had a party all night.

165
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:51,650
Hurry up and go wash up.

166
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,830
Did you catch a cold too?

167
00:13:56,830 --> 00:14:00,360
Yes, maybe. I was fine until yesterday.

168
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:03,950
But you too? Did someone else catch a cold?

169
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:05,870
No-

170
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:08,930
A lot of people seem to catch it lately.

171
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:13,820
Let's see.

172
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:17,250
We're out of cold medicine. Stay here, let me go buy some.

173
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:22,560
Hey, hey. Sit down, sit down. The pharmacy isn't even open yet.

174
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,250
- Is it too early? <br> - Yeah.

175
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:28,810
Ah, then I'll pack you some fruit. Have some at work.

176
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:32,310
You have to take a lot of vitamins at times like this.

177
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:36,470
I'll get you some sesame mushroom soup after work. You eat that the cold is gone.

178
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:39,570
It's fine. I'll get over it soon.

179
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:42,660
You have to fight the cold off at the beginning of it.

180
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,790
Go to the hospital if you start sweating, got it?

181
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:46,780
Yes.

182
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:54,400
<i>Dongseng's first love ate the whole bowl of porridge and is all better now. </i>

183
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,090
<i>Mission complete.</i>

184
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:58,220
It's a relief.

185
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,610
<i>I fell asleep so I didn't get to see you leave. </i>

186
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:09,240
<i>Thank you for the porridge. I'll call you later.</i>

187
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,050
Porridge?

188
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:13,870
Well, porridge or soup.

189
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,630
Deputy Chief Editor you're awesome!

190
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:19,680
Did you bring it back from the U.S.? This underwear?

191
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,870
- Made in U.S.A.? America? <br> - Yes.

192
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:26,750
Maybe because it came across the ocean, it's so wearable!

193
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:29,950
By any chance, can't you give me two or so more?

194
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:32,430
Or is it something I can buy here? This underwear?

195
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:35,700
Continuing with the underwear! Underwear! Really!

196
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:42,310
Ah, really. I wish you would stop that underwear talk and that peculiar behavior too.

197
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:46,410
Eyy! Let's share the information, please.

198
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:49,120
- Please get off of me. <br> - Huh?

199
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:53,890
We even spent the night together. You're trying to keep your distance too much, Deputy Chief Editor.

200
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:56,390
- Come here. <br> - I said stop sticking to me! Seriously!

201
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:58,500
Come-

202
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,190
What is that cologne?

203
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:04,630
What is your cologne I said!

204
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,590
Come on!

205
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,140
What is with that combination?

206
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:10,980
Come on. How much is it?

207
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:13,260
Were they always that close?

208
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:15,840
Who cares?

209
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:19,130
Oh, Joon Woo!

210
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:21,490
- Hello. <br> - You were here.

211
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:23,100
You're have a subtly good sense of style.

212
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,760
What is that combination now?

213
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:34,040
<i>From now on, I will stay with you.</i>

214
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:38,950
<i>I will be your umbrella.</i>

215
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:47,840
<i>♫ Just like me, they long to be ♫ </i>

216
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,250
- Hye Jin <br> <i>♫ close to you. ♫ </i>

217
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:56,190
Ah, good morning.

218
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:59,050
Are you feeling a little better?

219
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:01,730
Ah, well...

220
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:06,920
- Look, Intern. <br> - Yes?

221
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:11,790
Ah, why did you tell that Reporter Kim and make it so annoying for me?

222
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:16,000
Because of him, my apartment is like messy trash-

223
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:22,900
What are you trying to do with that bizarre face?

224
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:29,240
What to do?!

225
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:32,600
I-I'm sorry.

226
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:37,020
Ah. It's okay.

227
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:38,710
He...he..here too it splattered.

228
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:41,210
Ah, it's okay.

229
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:42,680
I said it's oka-

230
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:45,200
Ah really! I told you it's okay!

231
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,120
I'm sorry.

232
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:58,210
You were so determined to come up. Why haven't you gone in yet?

233
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:00,690
Perhaps, you were waiting for me?

234
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:03,170
There's no way.

235
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:09,130
It's entertaining to make fun of that one too.

236
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:11,260
Underwear..

237
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:13,240
Here, Director Cha...

238
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,110
Hye Jin, do you have a cold?

239
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:21,000
Hye Jin, you can't get disappointed because we have work to do.

240
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,020
Next week is our deadline so if we don't get it finished, we're done.

241
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,880
You understand our situation, right? You have to understand it.

242
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,600
Yes, I understand.

243
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:36,190
Ah, really everyone is just too much. Treating someone like a virus.

244
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:38,350
So Jackson, is it a cold?

245
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:40,390
Yes. I think so.

246
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:43,920
Ah! I told you to go outside!

247
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,430
Huh?

248
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:56,770
I told you not to do that. Here. It's bad.

249
00:18:56,770 --> 00:19:00,600
Put your mask on.

250
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:05,460
Hye Jin, here.

251
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:40,320
Hye Jin.

252
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,500
This completed translation. Here and here, please supplement it.

253
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,870
Yes, I will do it.

254
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,830
Jackson.

255
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:58,590
Oh it's cold! What is this?

256
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:00,200
Ah, stay still.

257
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,340
What are you doing?

258
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:07,390
Stop getting treated like a virus and stay like that. Take your medicine too.

259
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:10,430
You're not even feeling well so how can you take care of someone else?

260
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:12,160
I'm going.

261
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:32,900
- Look, Intern! <br> - Yes!

262
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:37,150
Why aren't you bringing me the minutes?

263
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:40,780
We didn't have a meeting today so what minutes..?

264
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:45,240
Who asked for today's? I meant yesterday's. Yesterday.

265
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:48,410
I gave yesterday's minutes to you yesterday.

266
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:50,980
I don't think I've seen it.

267
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:54,210
Yesterday, I left it on the top of your desk.

268
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:56,230
Ah, I'll get another copy made and quickly bring it to you.

269
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:57,850
Let's work properly. Properly.

270
00:20:57,850 --> 00:20:59,730
Yes.

271
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:02,510
I definitely gave him that yesterday.

272
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:06,010
What's with him? By the way, that cold medicine might make you drowsy.

273
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:08,970
If you get too sleepy, take a nap in the medical service room.

274
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:10,890
Okay?

275
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:12,500
Jackson?

276
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,130
Oh.

277
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:21,480
He takes care of me now that I've become his dongseng.

278
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:32,830
<i>We're going down.</i>

279
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:34,700
Wait for me! Deputy Chief Editor!

280
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,710
Deputy Chief!

281
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:48,370
What's with him?

282
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:51,870
Seriously, what is it?

283
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:02,600
What am I doing? Really?

284
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:05,390
Oh, Hye Jin.

285
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:08,450
Do you feel any better?

286
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:09,990
Thanks to you.

287
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:12,570
Thank you for last night and sorry.

288
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:16,460
Do you know the sesame mushroom soup eatery at the intersection?

289
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,460
Go and have lunch there later.

290
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:21,320
When I eat that there, my cold goes away.

291
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,570
Really?

292
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:25,000
Then let's have lunch there together later.

293
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,960
You made me porridge so I owe you one.

294
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:30,140
I'll pick you up at lunch time.

295
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,690
No.

296
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:34,270
Let's just meet there later.

297
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:42,400
Coming to my workplace is a little...you know.

298
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,020
Okay.

299
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:06,160
Why is it raining all of a sudden?

300
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:41,550
Oh, Hye Jin.

301
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:43,780
You're here?

302
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:45,780
Ah, it's raining all of a sudden.

303
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:49,110
I know. Is it a sudden shower?

304
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,370
What?

305
00:23:57,370 --> 00:23:58,830
It's that..

306
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:02,420
You used to hate the rain..

307
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,620
Right.

308
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:11,290
But..it's okay now.

309
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:12,930
Ah.

310
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:18,010
It's a green light!

311
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:24,100
<i> Oh! It's a go!</i>

312
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:27,470
<i> But, why do you always call the green light 'go'?</i>

313
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:29,190
<i> I call it a go because it's a go.</i>

314
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:30,520
<i> Then, what about the red light? </i>

315
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,720
<i> The red light? </i>

316
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:36,360
<i> The red light is the red light. My whole family does it. </i>

317
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:39,560
Aren't you coming?

318
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,760
Oh... Yes, I'm coming.

319
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:46,860
Oh! I think there's going to be a newly-published book. There's an article.

320
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:50,470
<i> My dear readers, I'd like to tell you that my new work is at the finishing stage.</i>

321
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:54,140
<i>I ask for a little more patience before we meet again soon. From, Ten</i>

322
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:56,920
Wow, that book is probably getting released soon.

323
00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:01,270
Hey, just thinking of the reviews is getting me excited.

324
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:03,740
Ah, but Sunbae. Have you heard the rumor?

325
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:05,460
Ten is supposed to be Korean.

326
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:07,110
An Ahjumma in her 40's at that.

327
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:10,290
Ahjumma in her 40's. Stop talking nonsense and hold this.

328
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:12,040
Scratch the middle of my back.

329
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:15,820
Harder. Before, everyone said that the person was French.

330
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:19,010
That JE's Guillaume or whoever.

331
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:20,970
And last year, they said it was an American,

332
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:24,740
JE's Douglas K. There was all that fuss about it. Do you remember or not?

333
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:27,630
I heard that Ten is Murakami.

334
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:29,090
That he was hiding it on purpose.

335
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:30,560
Ten is Haruki?

336
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:33,660
That's doesn't make any sense. They have totally different styles.

337
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:34,900
What do you mean, Haruki?

338
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,360
No one knows.

339
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:40,230
Joanne Rowling too. Once she got famous, she hid her name and published a mystery novel.

340
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:41,870
No, that's not right.

341
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:44,820
According to a reliable source, it's definitely a Korean.

342
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:46,730
An Ahjumma in her 40's at that.

343
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:49,670
Where did you find your source? Will you tell me?

Huh? An onion?

350
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:11,280
Does anyone know what this onion is?

351
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:13,330
- Not sure. <br> - I don't know.

352

Ah, that's a prop we're going to use at the photo shoot.

353
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:18,980
It's an onion directly imported from Italy. It's worth 1,000,000 Won. ($1000)

354
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:21,760
What? 1,000,000 Won!?

1,000,000 Won..!

- Please sort the mail. <br> - Yes.

361
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,690
Yes, this is the editing office of The Most.

Yes.

When you catch a cold, if you keep an onion nearby,

367
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:30,190
it's been said that it can lessen the strength of the cold virus.

00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:39,280
The more I like him, the more uneasy I become..

480
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:43,790
Someone who

481
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,900
I can't like.

482
00:40:48,930 --> 00:40:49,750
A married man?

483
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:51,540
No!

484
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:54,240
If not, a fugitive...

485
00:40:55,640 --> 00:41:00,510
a minor... Well, these days, kids develop a lot quicker.

486
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:04,050
But...still..a minor is a little bit...

487
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:06,030
Seriously, what do you think I am?

488
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:07,420
It's not like that.

489
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:10,080
If it's not, then what's the problem?

490
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,790
Just...

491
00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:17,980
someone whom I should have stopped liking sooner.

492
00:41:19,830 --> 00:41:23,460
But I didn't think I could stop it on my own so

493
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:26,170
I asked you for a favor, Mr. Suite 2014.

494
00:41:26,170 --> 00:41:30,600
Then, it's not a married man, not an fugitive and not a minor.

495
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,700
If you like him, then keep seeing him.

496
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:34,710
You can see him.

497
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:38,230
It's not that easy.

498
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:41,560
'Love is crazy and openly allowed.'

499
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:43,820
Even in movies, there's a line like that. ( From the movie, 'Her' )

500
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:45,220
Be crazy.

501
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:48,570
Doesn't everyone love while being that crazy?

502
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:51,530
Instead of needlessly complicating it,

503
00:41:51,530 --> 00:41:53,780
if you let yourself be crazy, it's simple.

504
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:56,510
Don't look back and regret it but

505
00:41:56,510 --> 00:41:58,670
just go for it.

506
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:18,340
What are you looking for?

507
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:26,440
<i>Ah, those shoes.</i>

508
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:29,170
<i>Now that you mention it, they were so unworn.</i>

509
00:42:29,170 --> 00:42:32,990
<i>I thought they were thrown out by mistake so I left them with the guard.</i>

510
00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:40,680
<i>In the end, if i have two legs, this is something that will forcibly end for me regardless of my own will.</i>

511
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:43,710
<i>Even if I get hurt, I want to try it.</i>

512
00:42:43,710 --> 00:42:47,310
<i>As far as I can go, I want to go.</i>

513
00:42:47,310 --> 00:42:53,090
<i> ♫ The one whom I've been waiting for. ♫ </i>

514
00:42:54,900 --> 00:43:01,970
<i> ♫ Maybe because I don't know about love, ♫ </i>

515
00:43:01,970 --> 00:43:08,590
<i> ♫ I couldn't say anything ♫ </i>

516
00:43:08,590 --> 00:43:12,070
<i> ♫ You were always near me ♫ </i>

517
00:43:12,070 --> 00:43:15,590
<i> ♫ The one who is looking at me ♫ </i>

518
00:43:15,590 --> 00:43:22,610
<i> ♫ I'm afraid you still don't know yet.</i> ♫

519
00:43:27,490 --> 00:43:34,530
<i> ♫ If I take a step, maybe you'll know me <i> ♫</i></i>

520
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:39,740
<i> ♫ Should I try to wait a little more <i> ♫</i></i>

521
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:47,810
<i> ♫ On my own, the love that I've started without you knowing ♫ </i>

522
00:43:47,810 --> 00:43:53,210
<i> ♫ Should we do it together now ♫ </i>

523
00:43:54,870 --> 00:44:01,840
♫ <i> Maybe because you're the only one I've known </i> ♫

524
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:08,440
♫ <i> I can't love anyone else </i> ♫

525
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:10,600
♫ <i> My heart keeps feeling strange <i> ♫</i></i>

526
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:13,950
<i> Oh, about that schedule for the location scouting,</i>

527
00:44:13,950 --> 00:44:18,840
<i>we're planning on looking near the sea in Gangwondo's Bosung where there's view of the landscape.</i>

528
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:21,090
<i> The concept is ' Traveling Alone' <i></i></i>

529
00:44:21,090 --> 00:44:26,780
<i> so we're thinking about capturing a model enjoying a tranquil afternoon by the sea.</i>

530
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:30,570
<i> Right now, we're in the process of looking elsewhere in the Bosung area and</i>

531
00:44:30,570 --> 00:44:34,680
<i> we just need Deputy Chief Editor to make your choice.</i>

532
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:36,730
Deputy Chief Editor.

533
00:44:36,730 --> 00:44:38,180
Yes?

534
00:44:40,410 --> 00:44:42,160
About the business trip.

535
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:43,770
How is it going?

536
00:44:43,770 --> 00:44:46,270
For now, it's been set for the day after tomorrow

537
00:44:46,270 --> 00:44:48,610
and we've reserved the condo that our company has there.

538
00:44:48,610 --> 00:44:51,110
Since you're the one in charge, you'll have to go and then

539
00:44:51,110 --> 00:44:54,950
Ah Reum and I. We three can go, was what I was thinking.

540
00:44:54,950 --> 00:44:57,450
I'm sorry, but can you take me out, Sunbae?

541
00:44:57,450 --> 00:44:59,460
- Why? <br> - There's an omission with the pictorial

542
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:02,160
so I think we'll have to do a supplementary shoot.

543
00:45:02,730 --> 00:45:05,190
Seol, you should go in my place.

544
00:45:05,190 --> 00:45:06,880
Me?

545
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:09,800
Ah, I already have so much to do..

546
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:12,610
Why don't we send Kim Hye Jin?

547
00:45:12,610 --> 00:45:14,550
What? Me?

548
00:45:14,550 --> 00:45:17,950
Since we have to go and arrange the site too,

549
00:45:17,950 --> 00:45:19,210
we should take Joon Woo.

550
00:45:19,210 --> 00:45:20,670
Joon Woo, you come with us.

551
00:45:20,670 --> 00:45:22,080
What? I will.

552
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:24,510
I'll just go.

553
00:45:24,510 --> 00:45:26,840
What good will Kim Hye Jin be there?

554
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:30,100
I should go even though I already have a lot on my plate.

555
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:32,400
<i>Finally, my chance!</i>

556
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:38,320
<i>Jackpot Kim Joon Woo, I will definitely make you mine!</i>

557
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:43,450
Where is the dryer?

558
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:58,110
<i>Do you remember the puzzle from back then? It was also in the box.</i>

559
00:45:58,110 --> 00:46:01,960
<i>Pu... zzle?</i>

560
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:04,760
<i>Ah, the peeping girl!</i>

561
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:07,400
<i> I was wondering why I had kept something like that but</i>

562
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:12,870
<i> once I started playing with the puzzle, I remembered doing it with you all the time.</i>

563
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:16,590
<i> I was thankful for it.</i>

564
00:46:21,230 --> 00:46:24,310
I'm here. I'll be up soon.

565
00:46:24,310 --> 00:46:26,060
Hye Jin!

566
00:46:26,060 --> 00:46:27,940
Oh, Seong Joon!

567
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:29,160
You've been waiting long?

568
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:31,260
Yeah. Let's go inside.

569
00:46:34,350 --> 00:46:36,280
Hye Jin?

570
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:45,820
I found this.

571
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:51,300
Oh, this.

572
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:54,110
It's been a really long time, hasn't it?

573
00:46:54,110 --> 00:46:59,040
I wasn't sure but when I looked for it, I still had it.

574
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:02,060
Isn't it amazing?

575
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:08,740
Right.

576
00:47:10,550 --> 00:47:12,630
It's the piece from that time.

577
00:47:14,830 --> 00:47:19,200
Who I knew from back then, that really was

578
00:47:20,130 --> 00:47:21,890
you.

579
00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:41,150
Omo, we meet at a place like this.

580
00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:43,080
Did you come here for dinner?

581
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:46,240
Isn't that obvious? We're at a restaurant.

582
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:50,650
Now it seems you're even lying about your name to get a man.

583
00:47:50,650 --> 00:47:54,050
Well, if you want to date more than one man,

584
00:47:54,050 --> 00:47:56,740
I'm sure there are times a lie is necessary.

585
00:47:56,740 --> 00:48:00,760
Is there anything else you're lying about beside your name?

586
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:04,680
I don't think it's any of your business.

587
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:09,380
I'm curious as to what kind of a man he is for you to be lying about your name.

588
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:11,280
Why don't you introduce me to him?

589
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:13,070
It's that..

590
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:17,110
there is a reason for it.

591
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:20,170
Pretend you didn't see me.

592
00:48:20,170 --> 00:48:22,540
Why should I do that?

593
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:26,810
No matter what, aren't you the one who dates men for fun?

594
00:48:26,810 --> 00:48:29,340
You being this way is a little

595
00:48:30,350 --> 00:48:32,560
new.

596
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:38,970
I'm begging you.

597
00:48:38,970 --> 00:48:41,430
Your voice was too low, so I couldn't hear you.

598
00:48:41,430 --> 00:48:43,800
Can you say that again?

599
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:48,470
I'm begging you.

600
00:48:52,710 --> 00:48:55,400
Please pretend you didn't see me.

601
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:58,770
Seong Joon, let's go.

602
00:48:58,770 --> 00:49:01,220
What's the matter all of a sudden? Are you not feeling well?

603
00:49:01,220 --> 00:49:03,090
Let's just get out quickly.

604
00:49:03,090 --> 00:49:05,170
Hye Jin, seriously, what's wrong?

605
00:49:05,170 --> 00:49:07,190
What's the matter?

606
00:49:07,190 --> 00:49:10,710
You two really seem to suit each other.

607
00:49:10,710 --> 00:49:12,130
Excuse me?

608
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:14,750
We'll meet again.

609
00:49:15,910 --> 00:49:18,200
Call me later.

610
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:27,600
Hye Jin!

611
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:29,340
Hye Jin!

612
00:49:30,230 --> 00:49:33,150
What's wrong? Who was that earlier?

613
00:49:33,150 --> 00:49:35,030
Hye Jin.

614
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:37,820
That name...

615
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:42,980
Don't call me that.

616
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:44,890
Look at me. Huh?

617
00:49:44,890 --> 00:49:47,160
First, look at my face.

618
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:53,880
Just stay like this for a minute.

619
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:56,180
Just for today.

620
00:49:57,570 --> 00:50:00,350
Don't ask me anything.

621
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:20,360
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to you by The Ugly Ducklings@Viki</i>

622
00:50:32,850 --> 00:50:36,060
You're late. Did you have a date somewhere again?

623
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:38,910
Yeah, something like that.

624
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:41,380
Did you eat? Should I make you something?

625
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:44,330
Of course I ate. Just look at the time.

626
00:50:44,330 --> 00:50:49,420
Oh that's right, I thought your blanket was too thin so I changed it to a thicker one.

627
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:51,160
You did?

628
00:50:53,190 --> 00:50:54,560
Thanks.

629
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:57,290
Hey, and what is that mess in your room?

630
00:50:57,290 --> 00:51:00,880
I nearly called the police because I thought we were broken into. Clean up once in awhile.

631
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:04,150
Ahhh! The pretty ones only know how to take care of themselves.

632
00:51:04,150 --> 00:51:08,340
They leave their room looking like a pig stye so a pig might mistake it for its house.

633
00:51:08,350 --> 00:51:10,380
Who will marry that?

634
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:21,370
Let's sleep together.

635
00:51:21,370 --> 00:51:24,610
What? You have a huge bed. Why?

636
00:51:24,610 --> 00:51:26,630
Ah, this is nice.

637
00:51:27,550 --> 00:51:31,090
Hey, must I sleep with that big body of yours?

638
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:37,420
I made it this small so you will let me sleep with you, right?

639
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:41,870
Hey, if you do that kind of a trick once more, I will...kill you!!!

640
00:51:41,870 --> 00:51:43,790
Hey! Tickle, tickle!

641
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:58,000
Why? What is it?

642
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:02,440
What?

643
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:08,180
You have something to tell me.

644
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:09,720
Yeah.

645
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:13,190
I do.

646
00:52:15,220 --> 00:52:17,300
I do, but...

647
00:52:22,270 --> 00:52:23,910
Later.

648
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:29,780
I'll tell you everything later.

649
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,240
Hye Jin.

650
00:52:33,290 --> 00:52:35,550
Until then,

651
00:52:37,310 --> 00:52:40,110
can you wait a bit?

652
00:52:43,710 --> 00:52:47,420
Are you going to be okay?

653
00:52:51,290 --> 00:52:56,060
Being okay... is hard.

654
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:00,060
Ha Ri.

655
00:53:01,070 --> 00:53:03,290
Oh, so nice.

656
00:53:03,290 --> 00:53:06,490
Should I keep sleeping here from now on?

657
00:53:06,490 --> 00:53:10,570
Dream on. Who said I'll let you sleep here?

658
00:53:18,390 --> 00:53:21,910
I'm not sure what's going on, but...

659
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:28,270
don't wander around too long.

660
00:53:32,670 --> 00:53:34,650
Okay.

661
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:39,870
Okay, Hye Jin.

662
00:55:03,220 --> 00:55:04,760
You came?

663
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:07,170
Business travel team, let's meet on the first floor at 10 o'clock.

664
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:09,010
Yes!

665
00:55:11,030 --> 00:55:12,730
Buongiorno! (Good morning)

666
00:55:12,730 --> 00:55:14,990
Hello.

667
00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:20,550
♫ <i> Caro mio bene </i> ♫

668
00:55:22,060 --> 00:55:24,000
Come in, come in.

669
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:29,970
What brings you here?

670
00:55:29,970 --> 00:55:33,610
Ah, Director Cha asked me to get these signed off for her.

671
00:55:33,610 --> 00:55:36,590
Cosa. What is it?

672
00:55:41,230 --> 00:55:44,160
But..

673
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:48,440
how long do I have to wait for you to become The Most-like?

674
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:51,190
What? Ah.

675
00:55:51,190 --> 00:55:54,420
I've been making an effort.

676
00:55:56,070 --> 00:55:58,710
Oh, Mamma.

677
00:55:58,710 --> 00:56:01,590
Troppo complicato! Troppo complicato! (Too complicated!)

678
00:56:01,590 --> 00:56:05,410
This style is absurd and hopeless.

679
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:08,340
I'm sorry.

680
00:56:09,150 --> 00:56:13,050
Omo, I feel nauseated. Again, I feel queasy.

681
00:56:13,050 --> 00:56:16,540
See? I keep feeling nauseous.

682
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:20,910
Please be The Most-like, with some sense of style. Okay?

683
00:56:20,910 --> 00:56:22,860
The Most-like, with a sense of style.

684
00:56:22,860 --> 00:56:24,760
Everything!

685
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:27,090
Even signing something like this,

686
00:56:27,090 --> 00:56:29,100
The Most-like.

687
00:56:29,100 --> 00:56:30,210
Like how?

688
00:56:30,210 --> 00:56:32,500
- The Most-like. <br> - Right.

689
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:34,170
Get out.

690
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:45,070
It hurts so much.

691
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:49,870
It's okay, it's okay.

692
00:56:49,870 --> 00:56:51,680
The Most-like.

693
00:57:02,380 --> 00:57:04,340
Fine. I will use it today.

694
00:57:04,340 --> 00:57:06,410
What did I do?

695
00:57:06,410 --> 00:57:10,500
<i>I, Kim Hye Jin, promise to comply with Kim Shin Hyeok's request three times, no matter what.</i>

696
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:12,460
Did you record that?

697
00:57:12,460 --> 00:57:16,120
Of course I did. In case you denied it.

698
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:20,640
I was going to ask you for more but I am naturally very gentle and soft-hearted.

699
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:22,860
I decided to go easy on you for our first time.

700
00:57:22,860 --> 00:57:26,320
Buy tonight's dinner. Make it whelk.

701
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:28,560
But add some plain noodles to it.

702
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:30,050
Okay well, whelk is easy enough.

703
00:57:30,050 --> 00:57:32,420
Yes! Whelk!

704
00:57:34,590 --> 00:57:36,720
Yes, i'll check on that.

705
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:38,570
Yes.

706
00:57:39,350 --> 00:57:40,970
I'm going crazy.

707
00:57:43,350 --> 00:57:45,600
- Hye Jin.<br>- Yes?

708
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:49,190
I'm sorry but you'll have to go on the business trip instead of me.

709
00:57:49,190 --> 00:57:50,800
What?

710
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:54,300
James Taylor's people called about the dress we're collaborating on

711
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:58,000
and they're sending the first draft of it in a few minutes.

712
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:01,430
I think I'll have to check it out and call them back.

713
00:58:02,350 --> 00:58:03,820
Hurry up and head down.

714
00:58:03,820 --> 00:58:05,820
Everyone should be waiting there since they have to leave soon.

715
00:58:05,820 --> 00:58:09,410
But, I didn't pack a bag.

716
00:58:10,890 --> 00:58:14,100
For now, take my luggage.

717
00:58:14,150 --> 00:58:16,660
Everything you need to change into and sleep in, there's enough for one night.

718
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:18,930
But, still...

719
00:58:18,930 --> 00:58:22,370
Hurry! They are all waiting.

720
00:58:22,370 --> 00:58:23,550
Move! Move!

721
00:58:23,550 --> 00:58:26,200
Ah, I'll be leaving.

722
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:28,940
Oh, my bag.

723
00:58:28,940 --> 00:58:30,960
Goodbye. I'll be leaving.

724
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:31,960
Hye Jin, take care!

725
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:35,160
Jackson! Whelk!

726
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:50,050
Kim Joon Woo!

727
00:58:52,350 --> 00:58:53,280
What's that car?

728
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:54,820
Let's you and I drive there together.

729
00:58:54,820 --> 00:58:56,960
Didn't we decide to go together in Deputy Chief Editor's car?

730
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:59,440
He said he'd be right out.

731
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:04,010
Well, there's a lot luggage and it's easier this way for traveling a long distance.

732
00:59:04,010 --> 00:59:06,580
I already told the Deputy Chief Editor and Sunbae Joo Yeong.

733
00:59:06,580 --> 00:59:08,250
Hurry, get in.

734
00:59:13,740 --> 00:59:16,140
I didn't hear about traveling separately.

735
00:59:16,140 --> 00:59:19,940
Ah, I told you that's what we decided to do.

736
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:23,320
What are you doing?

737
00:59:24,620 --> 00:59:27,190
You should have your seatbelt on.

738
00:59:27,190 --> 00:59:29,820
Oh, Kim Joon Woo, what are you thinking?

739
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:33,750
Oh, Kim Joon Woo, what's with you?

740
00:59:33,750 --> 00:59:38,410
No, nothing's up. I'm not thinking about anything.

741
00:59:57,730 --> 00:59:59,870
Where did they go?

742
01:00:06,410 --> 01:00:09,780
Director Cha has to take care of something urgent so

743
01:00:09,780 --> 01:00:13,460
she can't go on this trip and she told me to go instead.

744
01:00:13,460 --> 01:00:14,920
Oh.

745
01:00:40,530 --> 01:00:42,650
There's a piece of thread..

746
01:00:43,510 --> 01:00:45,390
Ah, that's okay.

747
01:00:45,390 --> 01:00:47,860
I'll do it.

748
01:00:57,550 --> 01:01:00,320
What? What does the text say?

749
01:01:03,010 --> 01:01:08,610
<i>Deputy Chief Editor, Joon Woo and I have something to take care of so we'll leave a little later.</i>

750
01:01:08,610 --> 01:01:11,350
<i>Go on ahead with Sunbae Joo Yeong.</i>

751
01:01:11,350 --> 01:01:12,390
Then...

752
01:01:12,390 --> 01:01:15,900
Let's get going.

753
01:01:22,150 --> 01:01:25,880
<i>What the? Ji Seong Joon and me are going alone?</i>

754
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:28,950
<i>Omo, what am I going to do?!</i>

755
01:01:32,830 --> 01:01:40,570
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to you by The Ugly Ducklings@Viki</i>

756
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:48,050
<i>She Was Pretty<br>Preview</i>

757
01:01:48,050 --> 01:01:49,530
<i>Business trip?</i>

758
01:01:49,530 --> 01:01:50,700
<i>Who with?</i>

759
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:51,760
<i>Ji Seong Joon!</i>

760
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:54,280
<i>The seaaa~!</i>

761
01:01:54,280 --> 01:01:59,430
<i>Then Jackson and the Deputy Chief Director are alone?</i>

762
01:01:59,430 --> 01:02:01,890
<i>Joon Woo, look at the stars.</i>

763
01:02:01,890 --> 01:02:03,160
<i>Deputy Chief Editor.</i>

764
01:02:03,160 --> 01:02:10,090
<i>Right now, I am going to tell you something that you might be shocked to hear.</i>

765
01:02:10,090 --> 01:02:11,550
<i>What are you saying right now?</i>

766
01:02:11,550 --> 01:02:13,900
<i>Truthfully, I...</i>
