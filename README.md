MoST - More Subtitles
=====================

Unofficial chrome extension for showing more subtitles at viki.com.

The code is largely inspired by chrome-subtitles and subber, but more minimal and targeted toward use at viki.com. It is commented and open-source, too. More most-like.

Install this under Tools -> Extensions (Enable developer mode) and then add this directory as an unpacked extension.

In this early version, only Korean is supported.
