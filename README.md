MoST Subtitles
==============

Unofficial chrome extension for showing more subtitles at viki.com.

The code is largely influenced by chrome-subtitles and subber, but more minimal and targeted toward use at viki.com. More most-like.

Install this under Tools -> Extensions (Enable developer mode) and then add this directory as an unpacked extension.
