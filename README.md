MoST - More Subtitles
=====================

Unofficial chrome extension for showing more subtitles at viki.com.

The code is largely inspired by chrome-subtitles and subber, but more minimal and targeted toward use at viki.com. It is commented and open-source, too. More most-like.

Install this under Tools -> Extensions (Enable developer mode) and then add this directory as an unpacked extension.

In early versions, only Korean was supported, but it is now possible to view as many languages as you want! In the options page, simply add more blocks, for example `.most-de { bottom: -100px; height: 100px; }` for German subtitles just below the player.
